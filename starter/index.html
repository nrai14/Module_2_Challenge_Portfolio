        <h3> About Me</h3>
        <p> In South East Surrey, born and raised.</p>
        <p>A sales environment was where I spent most of my days.</p>
        <p> Prospectin', power point presentin', every week.</p>
        <p> Started dreaming of a career change to seek. </p>
        <p> Then an EDX course popped up that seemed pretty good, </p>
        <p> which helped me ensure front end progamming was understood. </p>
        <p>I made this one little website and fell in love with it right there,</p>
        <p>so please feel free to look around and see what's here.</p>
