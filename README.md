#  Portfolio

## Description

For the second week of bootcamp, I created a website development portfolio utilisng HTML and CSS. Each section uses CSS Flexbox and Grid and throughout the course I will be seeking to update the placeholder images/texts once I have created other applications to replace them with. 

This task is important as it has been stressed that a strong portfolio will be key to achieving a full-time position, as it allows one to highlight their strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 

The portfolio successfully loads with:

* A page that presents my name, photo and links to sections about myself, my projects and a contact form
* The UI scrolls smoothly when links are clicked to navigate to the corresponding section
* Each work section contains titled placeholders and images for future applications
* Hovering over an image of the application results in a larger image being displayed 
* Upon being clicked, the image will take the user to the deployed application (currently linked to my GitHub repo, which will be updated, accordingly)
* Utilising Media Queiries for compatability and responsive design
